# NeoVim dot files

These are my configuration files for NeoVim

Do as you please with them. I will not be accepting github issues/prs for this repo, as these files are tuned to my own liking, which might perhaps not be what you like, which is fine by me.

## Main usage areas

I personally mainly use this configuration for web development. So it is set up to work with:

- Lua
- Vue
- Typescript/Javascript
- React

But can be easily set up to work with even more stuff!

## Inspiration

I've taken inspiration and assitance from many different sources to get all of this working right, everything from Vue's LSP (which is annoying af to get working lmao), to smaller stuff. Here's a list of some of the notable ones though.

- [Primeagen's nvim cfg](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua/tree/master): LSP & Autocompletion Handling
